# Movie-Recommendation
Recommend movies to the user using SVD




Using matrix factorization, from the user and movie informations, we are able to find a low-rank representation, which initive can be interpreted (in this example) as 'taste/genre' of movies. I.e. you are able to ascertain users with their taste in movies; and movies which correspond to the tastes/genres.
